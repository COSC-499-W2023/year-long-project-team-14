### Recap on your week's goals
- My priorities were to meet with our team to decide on all of the elements that would be integrated in our project, to finish the important milestones section of the project's outline, and to assist my group to establish and finish the collaborative division on our Kanban board.

### Which features were yours in the project plan for this milestone?
- My primary goal this week in our meeting was to finish the important technical objectives. I initiated our Kanban board in an online platform called trello and helped my teammates to assign tasks and complete the teamwork distribution. I have also created the excel file for our timestamps and tasks done with the burnup table and shared with my teammates. We have added the screenshots of our burnup table.
