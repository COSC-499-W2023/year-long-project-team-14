# Team 14 Log - Term 2 - Week 4
- Start Date: January 29
- End Date: February 4

## Milestone Goals:
This week our team succesfully held our first peer testing session. Overall the feedback for the game was incredibly positive and testers found it was enjoyable to play. Moving forward we will be adding additional abillities, different difficulty levels, and adding more levels to the game. Additionally, we are working on a mini-boss for the game which will have more advanced shooting patterns and challenge the player to navigate through the level carfully as they dodge attacks. With the addition of the win-screen, players are now able to beat the game and submit their completion time to the leaderboard.
