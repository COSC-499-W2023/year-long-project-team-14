# Team 14 Log - Term 2 - Week 5
- Start Date: February 5
- End Date: February 11

## Milestone Goals:
- This week our team added a functional mini-boss which has three different "bullet-hell" shooting patterns, the mini-boss has its own health system script and a randomized attack selector script which chooses attack pattterns randomly to increase encounter variety. Additionally, our team finalized the win menu screen, added an additional player ability, and collectable items so that players can pick-up and switch between the various available spells in the game. Additonally, the team brainstormed different quality-of-life adjustments which we plan to add to the game at a later date, such as the ability to fire multiple shots in a row while holding down the trigger. For this upcoming milestone, we aim to add additional abilities and work towards adding 4 different difficulties to appeal to a larger audience. The hardest of which will be called "madness" mode and the most difficult version of the game to beat.
