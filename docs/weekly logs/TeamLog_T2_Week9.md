# Team 14 Log - Term 2 - Week 9
- Start Date: March 4
- End Date: March 10

## Milestone Goals:
- The second peer testing session was a great success and allowed us to gather more feedback about the game! We've compiled relevant constructive feedback below, and we aim to improve upon the game by adding these feedback points. Additionally, our team worked on various bug fixes and game features such as new levels with much more variety in level design, additional abilities, updated sprites, and re-balanced certain existing gameplay mechanics prior to the second peer testing session. As we work towards the next milestone, we plan on continuing to test out different values for certain gameplay aspects such as player/enemy health and ability cooldowns to see what works best.
