## Milestone Goals:
- For the first milestone, we plan to have a basic implementation of the player character, and complete the features that were in progress from the previous weekly check-in. At the end of this milestone, we aim to have a simple prototype where you can start a game from the main menu, move around as the player in the level template with working animations, aim using mouse position or controller input, shoot bullets, and pause the game.
