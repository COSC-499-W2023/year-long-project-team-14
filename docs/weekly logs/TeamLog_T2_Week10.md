## Milestone Goals:

- This week our team was able to address the issues we had encountered regarding LFS objects and worked towards adding additional gameplay features for the game such as new abilities, and adding more functionality to the final boss encounter. Additionally, in our most recent team meeting we reassessed our goals for which features to complete first ahead of the final milestone where we will release the final version of the game. We have also added more levels and discussed further balancing changes to ensure it is in line with peer testing feedback and player expectations. Overall, we are very happy with how far the game has come thus far!
