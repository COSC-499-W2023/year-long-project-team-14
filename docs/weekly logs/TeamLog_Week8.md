# Team 14 Log - Week 8
- Start Date: October 23
- End Date: October 29

## Milestone Goals:
- For this week, we set out to learn the NUnit testing framework for implementing automated testing in Unity for each feature we have implemented thus far. Additionally, we aimed to improve the functionality of the first draft of the main menu and added controller support using Unity's new Input System. At the end of this milestone, we aim to have unit testing finished for each associated feature implemented so far and refine our features for the live demo mini-presentation. As well as have a good idea of how we will allocate time for the 5 minute mini-presenstion. We have also designed a logo for our game.
