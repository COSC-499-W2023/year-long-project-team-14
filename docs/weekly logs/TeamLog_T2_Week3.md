# Team 14 Log - Term 2 - Week 3
- Start Date: January 22
- End Date: January 27

## Milestone Goals:
This week our team work on additional player abilities, gameplay mechanics, and added additional unit testing for our features. The goal of adding abilities was to give the gameplay more variety and provide the player with different ways to defeat enemies and beat a given level. Additionally, this week we aimed to add a dash ability which increased the pace of the game and gives the player more freedom to move around. We also worked towards adding a win screen when a player beats the game which displays your score in time for the peer testing session.
